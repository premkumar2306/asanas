Exhale and bend forward from your hips, keeping your knees straight or slightly bent if needed. Reach down with your hands and hold your big toes with your thumb, index, and middle fingers. If you can't reach your toes, you can use a strap or hold onto your ankles or shins. With each inhale, lengthen your spine and look forward. With each exhale, fold deeper into the pose, bringing your chest closer to your thighs. Try to straighten your legs as much as you comfortably can, but don't strain or force them to be completely straight. Keep your weight balanced between the balls and heels of your feet, and actively engage your quadriceps to support your legs. Relax your neck and let your head hang, allowing any tension to release. Hold the pose for 5-10 breaths, breathing deeply and maintaining a steady, relaxed breath.",
